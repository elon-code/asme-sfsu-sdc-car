Please be aware that this project must run on Platform.io (https://platformio.org/)

This project was programmed on an Arduino Pro Mini 3.3v 8 Mhz, please be sure to change board on platform.io to this to insure compatibility. Was coded using Arduino platform in platform.io

The remote control software is available for free from Arduino Blue. The app is available for both IOS and Android and interfaces with the arduino through BLE protocol. https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/arduinoble/

The only other dependencies are the arduino servo and software serial libraries. These are all included in the platform config file.

The competition was the 2021 ASME E-Fest Student Design Competition. See rules folder for rules.
